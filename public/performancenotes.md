Click "Start" to start audio and open the score. The pagedown keypress event is used to sequence through each part of the piece. To use this patch with a page turn pedal, ensure that the mode is set to transmit page down events. The current position is indicated with a chevron to the right of the staves.

For rehearsals, Click on a staff to move the playback back to that position.
